PyCity Schools Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-	At the district level, there are 15 schools in which greater proportion of students performed beyond 
	average in either math and reading but the overall passing rate in math and reading per student dropped. 
-	There are more charter schools than district schools. Charter schools dominated in the top overall performing schools.
-	The 5 lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) are all district, even despite their higher per student budget.
-	There seem not to be much variance in the average math/reading scores per grade per school in the district.
-	The spending ranges per student further reveals a reciprocal relationship between spending (budget) 
	per student and the % overall passing. The highest spending per student bin ($645-$675) has the lowest overall passing rate.
-	From the analysis, high % of district schools fall under the highest spending per student bin category.
-	Further, looking critically at the result from school size summary, there is also a reciprocal relationship 
	between school and the % overall passing. Small-size schools, like the ones with less than 1000 student population performed best overall.
-	The charter schools show a remarkable performance with about 90% overall passing than district schools with about 54% overall passing rate.

Conclusion:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the information and the analysis:
-	Schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. 
	Charter schools outperformed the public district schools across all metrics. 
-	However, deeper analysis should be undertaken to determine whether the abysmal 
	performance in the districts is as a result of poor school management practices, and 
	lack of appropriate governance to drive value-for-money objectives in school management policies. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations:
There seems to be some limitations to this analysis/data: 
-	The information provided on PyCity Schools Analysis does not reveal the competence of school board and the teaching staff in each school, either district or charter. 
-	The results are based only on math and reading. Other subjects are not mentioned; probably the district could be doing well in other subjects.
